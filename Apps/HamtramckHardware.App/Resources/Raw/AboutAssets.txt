Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories). Deployment of the asset to your application
is automatically handled by the following MSBuild targets:

1. '_CreateMauiAssetItems' - adds 'MauiAsset' items for packaging
2. 'BuildMauiAssets' - processes 'MauiAsset' items for inclusion

To add an asset to your application, add the file to this directory.
